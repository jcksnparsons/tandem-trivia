# Tandem for 400!

A command line application built with Python as a coding challenge for Tandem.

## How to access

1. Make sure you have [Python] (https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
2. Once you have Python installed, clone down this repo using your terminal and navigate to the directory.
3. Run this command and enjoy!:
```
python main.py
```

## Tech

This application was built exclusively using Python 3.8.1. My goal with this project was to use as few outside libraries as possible and write a clean and effective solution utilizing just vanilla Python.
